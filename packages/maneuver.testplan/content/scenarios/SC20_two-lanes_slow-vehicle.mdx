title: Two Lanes w/ Slow Leading Vehicle
---


# Situation Overview

Route is a two lanes config with a fork, two cases are tested:

1- front vehicle slow, route guidance is turn right with **comfortable time-to-abort**

2- front vehicle slow, route guidance is turn right with **too-short time-to-abort**

These two scenarios test the Strategy module which shall create
a tactical instruction **SRTakeLeft** in order to pass the slow vehicle, in the **first case only**.

## 1. large tta: Strategy **triggers** a laneMerge


<FeatMap>

## route

- lanes = ['C']
- road.fork(lane: C)
- **RGTakeRight** large tta
- slow front vehicle

## virtual lane

- push NR.lane to lane queue

## strategy

- output to decision due to large tta:
    **SRTakeLeft**
- output to execution:
    target-lane = NL

## decision

- output **LaneMergeLeft**

## execution

- executes LaneMergeLeft procedure
   - To Specify: _selects front vehicle for its speed/acceleration profile during the merge_


</FeatMap>


## 2. small tta: Strategy **avoids** the laneMerge


<FeatMap>

## route

- lanes = ['C']
- road.fork(lane: C)
- **RGTakeRight** small tta
- slow front vehicle

## virtual lane

- push C.lane to lane queue

## strategy

- output to decision due to small tta:
    **SRContinueOn**
- output to execution:
    target-lane = fork.right

## decision

- output **LaneKeepSame**

## execution

- executes LaneKeepSame procedure:
  - slows-down to keep safe distance from front vehicle
  - take the right fork when reached
