title: Two Lanes Take Right
---


# Situation Overview

Route is a two lanes config with a fork, NV has a NR, RGTakeRight.
Two cases are considered:

1- large tta, route guidance is turn right with **comfortable time-to-abort**

2- small tta, route guidance is turn right with **too-short time-to-abort**

Here we want to review the Strategy feature:
- does it add a fake obstacle at the fork location and keep **SRTakeRitht** whether tta is small or large
- or does it prevent the merge right to happen by issueing **SRContinueOn** when tta is small

## 1. large tta: Strategy **triggers** a laneMerge


<FeatMap>

## route

- lanes = ['C','NR']
- road.fork(lane: C)
- **RGTakeRight** large tta

## virtual lane

- push C.lane to lane queue

## strategy

- output to decision due to large tta:
    - **SRTakeRight**
    - _Add Obstacle at tta?_

- output to execution:
    target-lane = NL

## decision

- output **LaneMergeRight**

## execution

- executes LaneMergeRight procedure
   - To Specify: _NV speed stays same_


</FeatMap>


## 2. small tta: Strategy **avoids** the laneMerge


<FeatMap>

## route

- lanes = ['C','NR']
- road.fork(lane: C)
- **RGTakeRight** small tta

## virtual lane

- push C.lane to lane queue

## strategy

- output to decision due to small tta:
    option1: **SRContinueOn**
    option2: **SRTakeRight** with **obstacle at tta**
- output to execution:
    target-lane = NR

## decision

- output **LaneKeepSame**, _avoids **LaneTakeRight**_

## execution

- executes LaneKeepSame procedure
